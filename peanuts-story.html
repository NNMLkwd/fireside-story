    <h1>It was a dark and stormy night...</h1>
    
        <p>Woodstock was snoring so loud, that he was drowning out the storm, and poor Snoopy was unable to go back to sleep.</p>
          
        <p>Snoopy wished for a bowl of warm milk but didn't have a hot plate.</p>

    
        <p>Meanwhile, indoors, Charlie Brown was staring into the storm. In his mind the rolling thunder clouds and pouring rain were not a storm but his inner ennui.</p> <br>

    <p>Sally, two blocks away, was also unable to sleep, not due to angst but excitement from another football stunt.<br>

        <p>Charlie had fallen for it again.</p>
